Hi! I'm **Lucas**, a systems engineer with a passion for technology, communication, and open knowledge.

I'm also a **licensed amateur radio operator**, with the call sign **LU6DLV**.  
I enjoy exploring the world of radio communications and being part of the global ham radio community.

This blog is where I share ideas, projects, and experiments â€” both technical and personal.

Thanks for stopping by!
